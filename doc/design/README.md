Each document here describes designs with a different approach each of them having their own advantages and disadvatanges:

* [MONOLITH](./MONOLITH.md) explores a potential "self-sufficient" approach
* [WSGW-BASED](./WSGW-BASED.md) explores an approach using a service offering functionality similar to what is offered by [pdkovacs/websocket-gateway](/https://github.com/pdkovacs/websocket-gateway)

The implementation uses the `<to-be-decided-but-most-probably-the-wsg-based>` approach.
